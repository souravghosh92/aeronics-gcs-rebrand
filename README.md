# Aeronics GCS (Rebranded QGroundControl – Android)

This repo automatically rebrands the official QGroundControl APK to **Aeronics GCS** and produces an installable APK via GitHub Actions.

## How to build
1. Upload branding images into `branding/`:
   - `aeronics_icon_512.png` (required)
   - `aeronics_logo_wordmark.png` (optional but recommended)
2. Go to **Actions → Run workflow**, paste the official QGC APK URL.
3. Download the artifact **Aeronics-GCS.apk**.

**License**: Based on QGroundControl (GPLv3). All upstream licenses and notices retained.
